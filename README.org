* clj-bibtex

  A simple wrapper around [[https://github.com/jbibtex/jbibtex][jbibtex]], for
  handling BibTeX bibliographies.

  =jbibtex= is a nice, robust library, but it is a bit too OO to use with direct
  interop. =clj-bibtex= provides a way to load a =.bib= file into plain Clojure
  data structures.

  The idea is to build on top of this some functionality for managing the
  bibliography ()
** Usage
   For the time being, the API is limited to simply processing a =.bib= file,
   passed as an absolute path to =parse-bibliography=.
 

** Options

   None! Simple, isn't it? 

** Examples

   If you start a REPL in this project, you can test it with  
#+begin_src clojure :exports code
(parse-bibliography (->> "samples/literature.bib"
                       io/resource
                       io/as-file
                       (#(.getPath %))))
#+end_src
